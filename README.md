# Resume Developer Test

This is a site I built to upload my resume to [RPS](https://www.rpsins.com/). This is for personal, educational purposes and is not intended to be used by any other person or entity other than the author and RPS for code analysis purposes. If you wish to apply to RPS, you should write your own application to access their API, as that is part of the developer test process and they will want to see what you did to accomplish it.

# Contributing

I am not accepting contributions to this project, as it is intended to demonstrate my solely written code used to upload a resume to RPS.
